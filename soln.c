     * Readers lock r, so all but one gets through, and the rest block. For the
     * one that gets through, there are two cases. Since rc starts at zero and
     * every increment is followed by a decrement, rc>=0
     *
     * Case 1: rc==0
     * If rc is 0, there are no readers reading, so the current reader is the
     * first. It then locks rw thus preventing writers from entering. If a
     * writer already locked it, the reader will block here until the writer is
     * done. While it's blocked any other readers are still blocked on r above
     * ensuring that no other readers enter while the writer is writing. When
     * the lock is released and the first reader is able to lock rw, it unlocks
     * r and starts reading. Any immediate subsequent readers fall into case 2
     * now that rc has been incremented.
     *
     * Case 2: rc>0
     * If rc is non zero, the readers are able to lock r, increment rc, and
     * unlock r for the next reader. They don't attempt to lock rw since rc==0
     * is false and therefore will never block.

     * so rc>=1
     *
     * Case 1: rc==1
     * If rc==1, then it's the only reader reading. Since r is locked, no
     * readers can enter. rc is decremented before boolean evaluation so the if
     * statement is true and rw is unlocked.
